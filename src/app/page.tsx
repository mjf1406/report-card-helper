                It means that this app is still being tested and you should NOT
                rely on it to keep any data you input into it safe. Make sure
                you have backups in case there is a catastrophic failure of data

                You do not have to manually type student names or numbers into
                the PDF. You also do not have to copy and paste any Subject

                Why can I not import my class from Google Classroom?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                There are a few reasons: (1) Google Classroom does not have
                student numbers, so you would have to manually input that on
                this site. I think there would be more friction inputting the
                student numbers on the site than in Google Sheets. (2) Not all
                grades use Google Classroom. The template allows all grades to
                use the site. (3) I think it is probable that a large majority
                of teachers already have 2 or 3 of the 4 columns filled in on
                some Google Sheet, so they can easily copy and paste them into
                the template.
